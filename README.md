Creating a dashboard app with streamlit

The script creates a dynamic web application for visualizing and analyzing stock data using the Streamlit and Plotly libraries. The application allows users to select different types of charts (scatterplot, line plot, histogram, box plot, or bar chart) for different features of the stock data. The dataset used is preloaded from a CSV file and includes data for multiple companies. The application provides an option to display the dataset and allows the user to select which company's data to visualize. It demonstrates proficient use of Python's data analysis and web libraries to create an interactive stock analysis tool.
